# A bad precendent, much misunderstood

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p>I really dislike Direct Rule for Northern Ireland because I do not believe they are like the Scots or the Welsh and doubt if they ever will be.

The story of *the right of the people of Northern Ireland to have a vote on Irish unity* is a long and complex one. In its latest incarnation it is:

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p>1 Status of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>(1) It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom and shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the purposes of this section in accordance with Schedule 1.

To understand how we ended up here after Good Friday you need to go back, way back to the two Boer Wars.

The British picked up the Dutch colony of the Cape Of Good Hope at the end of the Napoleonic war and triggered a long ethnic conflict. The British wanted an Anglo-settler state, and the Afrikaners a Dutch-one (both sides colluding in a racial conspiracy of white against african of course). As the Anglo-tide swelled, the Dutch trekked north to creating a series of self-styled republics of which a couple, Transvaal and the Orange Free State acquired international recognition.

These stood in the way of the British dream of a Cairo-to-Cape continental railway and were attacked by the British after a series of pretexts.

The mighty Empire was humiliated by the farmer's republics but prevailed eventually and all the Dutch colonial republics were absorbed into South Africa. The cost of victory was surrendering the internal cultural war - South Africa was not be an Anglo-settler colony but a Dutch one, an Afrikaner one.

The core British goal during the independence struggle in Ireland after the great war was to retain Ireland for Empire - a South African peace. But the internal political struggle in Ireland was one for ethnic control, the dominant protestant/British resisting power sharing with the catholic/Irish majority - particularly in the north.

The Unionists fear of ethnic domination for the greater good were assuaged by the fact that their parliament, the Northern Parliament under the Ireland Act 1920 would need to give its consent for Irish Unity. The Ireland Act proposed 2 parliaments for an Ireland-within-Empire.

The retention of Ireland in Empire was in practice a dead duck, potent enough to cause the Irish Civil War, but Dublin just acted as if it were independent. The final break, in 1949, ended up being underwhelming.

When the constitutional crisis in the North heated up and the first Direct Rule Bill was drafted in 1968, a good 8 months before the conventionally accepted first death of the modern troubles, this posed a legal problem.

The Draft Bill transferred the powers of the Parliament to the Governor General - if the Parliament could vote for union with the south, the Governor General could simply enact it with a stroke of his pen. The Unionist backstop was transferred from the Parliament to the People.

The Northern Ireland precedent is a bad one for Scotland because it is designed not to enable and empower the electorate of Northern Ireland but to constrain the British Government. It is not practical nor invokable *because that is not its function* - its function is to reassure.
