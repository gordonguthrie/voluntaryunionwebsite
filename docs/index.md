# Crisis? What Crisis?

The UK is in deep constitutional crisis, with an unprecedented foreign customs border down the Irish sea, continued agitation for independence in Scotland, a collapsed government in Northern Ireland, a stagnating economy, rampant corruption including the sale of places in the upper of the houses of Parliament, the rotting sore of Brexit and the loss of a role in the wider world. The constitution cannot stand.

The SNP is trapped in two worlds - in one world we cut the Gordian knot and simply leave the UK and its constitutional crises and chart a course for normality and return to the EU.

In the other world accession to the EU is contingent on recognition - acceptance by the rUK that we are an independent country.

The SNP strategy to date has been one of Voluntary Union by request *may we have a Section 30 referendum?* and *is a Holyrood referendum legal?*

The Party meets in March to thrash through the details of its strategy currently articulated as *election-as-referendum*.

In the run up to the autumn conference I wrote extensively ([1](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2022/10/03/92241/), [2](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2022/10/04/stronger-things/), [3](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2022/10/05/future-sovereignty/), [4](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2022/10/06/under-what-circumstances-would-the-snp-green-government-trigger-a-holyrood-special-election-in-defence-of-devolution/), [5](https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2022/10/07/under-what-circumstances-if-at-all-would-the-snp-government-move-to-open-defiance-of-westminster/)), about questions that we need to clarify:

1. Which election is the referendum? next Holyrood?, Special Holyrood?, next Westminster? And what is the referendum-election question? *Should Scotland be independent* or *Does Scotland have the right to an indyref?*
2. Under what circumstances would the SNP participate in a Labour-led constitutional process if it brought PR and reformed the Lords?
3. Under what circumstances would the SNP-Green government trigger a Holyrood Special Election in defence of devolution?
4. Under what circumstances, if at all, would the SNP government move to open defiance of Westminster?

Those questions still stand.

The reality is that the SNP doesn't need *a strategy*  it needs a whole suite of approaches that it can follow.

We have been trying to establish a voluntary union and we should continue. Every time our opponents are forced to put a sign saying *No Voluntary Union this way* we accumulate a bit more support and their base shrinks.

This proposal is to complement *election-as-referendum* with an approach in which the Scottish Government acts as the adult in room and engages with other governments and political actors in the UK and Commonwealth with a view to putting the Union on a statutory, constitutional and voluntary basis.

<span class="newthought">A start</span> must be made, and a draft [Act of Voluntary Union](https://github.com/gordonguthrie/voluntaryunion) is a start. It defines a constitutional process.

It is not the last word, it is the first word. In the world of TikTok and remixes it is [available freely](./why_github.html) for anyone, SNP, Labour, in Scotland or furth of her, who wants to take and remix, rewrite, adapt. The precondition for enconstitutionalising is agreeing a process to do that. This Bill, based on long standing UK precedents is one way, it would be better with other input, criticisms and experience being applied to the draft.

It is also my intention to furnish people with the arguments and facts to think about how we should approach voters who are at best ambivalent or anxious about independence.

## Further Reading

This draft bill is based on the Northern Ireland Constitution Act (1973) which on first blush is an eccentric choice, but I would argue it is [less eccentric](./why_base_it_on_the_NI_Constitution_Act_1973.html) when examined in context.

The fact that an Act of Union, even one of Voluntary Union, has been drafted by an SNP militant probably seems even more eccentric - but it is [rooted in commonsense](how_does_an_SNP_member_end_up_writing_an_Act_of_Union). The SNP as a party of government, and an aspiring leader of a political process leading to independence has to talk to and for all the voters of Scotland.

The best framework to consider Gordon Brown's constitutional proposals is by [comparison with Donald Dewar's approach to devolution](dewar_vs_brown.html). His proposals are at best [delaying tactics](./popular_sovereignty.html) until Labour can squeeze into power in Holyrood.

This is part of a wider project to encourage Scottish civil and political society to write draft [Members](https://www.parliament.scot/about/how-parliament-works/parliament-rules-and-guidance/standing-orders/chapter-9-public-bill-procedures#topOfNav) and [Private](https://www.parliament.scot/about/how-parliament-works/parliament-rules-and-guidance/standing-orders/chapter-9a-private-bill-procedures#topOfNav) Bills with a view to getting them introduced in the Scottish Parliament. To that end I am seek collaborators to work on a Draft Bill of the Scottish Parliament to provide autonomy for the Gàidhealtachd based on the [Åland Islands Autonomy Statue](./resources/FI_SE_930101_Act_on_the_Autonomy_of_Aland.pdf).
