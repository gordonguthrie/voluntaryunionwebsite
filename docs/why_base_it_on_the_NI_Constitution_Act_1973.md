# Why base it on the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973?

This Bill is based on the [Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/36/contents/enacted) - that lost masterpiece.

Under the pressures of violence and the global impact of Bloody Sunday, the 1920 settlement of Ireland was swept away with the [Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/22/enacted). Direct Rule was intended to last a year - and the Temporary Provisions needed annual renewal.

The 1920 Act had reserved the decision as to whether Northern Ireland joined Southern Ireland (as it was then referred to) or remained in the UK to the Northern Irish Parliament.

The new constitutional drive from Westminster was built on two foundations:

* popular sovereignty
* consensus and and agreed constitution across the communities in Northern Ireland.

The first meant that any change in the status of Northern Ireland required the electorate to give their approval. This was embodied in the [Northern Ireland (Border Poll) Order 1973](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1973/97/contents/made). The border poll was marred by abstentionism from the Nationalists side, it was won 98.9% to 1.1% on a turnout of 58.7%.

The second was achieved by the Northern Ireland Constitution Act. An assembly was elected by proportional representation with 2/3 majority for power sharing and after a protracted debate between May and December 1973,  including tripartite talks with the Irish Republic at Sunningdale, a new constitutional settlement was thrashed out. The new Executive came to power on 1st January 1974.

Unfortunately UK politics intervened and a snap general election was called for the 28th February. Violence had worsened since the summer of 1973 and anti-power sharing coalition narrowly won the election 51% to 49%. The FPTP electoral system performed the same fatal task it had done in the 1918 election and delivered them an 11-1 seat victory. The anti-power sharing parties immediately started conspiring with trade unionists and loyalist paramilitaries leading to an armed strike in May. The failure of the British Army to confront and clear the intimidation less to splits in the pro-power sharing Unionists and the Executive fell.

By automatic application of statute the entire government apparatus was then prorogued - initially for 4 months but in practice for another 21 years.

The power and importance of the Sunningdale Agreement was that the eventual solution to the prolonged agony of Northern Ireland, the Good Friday process, was Sunningdale for slow learners.

1973 is constitutionally the year zero for three reasons:

* it established constitutional referenda as the primary mechanism for popular consent
* political rights that had in 1920 been delegated to the Stormont Parliament were move irrevocably to the people of Northern Ireland - popular sovereignty runs like a golden thread through all British political discussion about Northern Ireland since that time
* it contains the genesis of the idea that while constitutional change is desirable and appropriate for the peripheries it must be decoupled so it has no constitutional impact on Westminster.

The UK took to this new constitutional device of referendums with gusto: leading to subsequent referendums of the sovereign Scottish people in 1979, 1997 and 2014, the sovereign Welsh people in 1978, 1997 and 2011 and Northern Ireland again in 1998. In addition there were 3 UK wide votes during the same period - on joining Europe in 1975, on leaving Europe in 2016 and on voting system reform in 2011.

In addition England has had a series of local votes on devolution in the North East, to London, on local mayors and so on and so forth.

The second pillar is, popular sovereignty, is taken for granted everywhere except among the political class at Westminster.

The political collapse of the UK is driven by the third, parliamentary sovereignty and an out of control executive.
