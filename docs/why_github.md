# Why publish it on GitHub?

[Github](https://github.com) is a major website where software developers share their code and collaborate on developing new computer systems.

But computer systems in their raw state are just files of text. It can be used by anyone to collaborate on shared text.

A number of legislatures like [Washington DC](https://github.com/DCCouncil/law-xml), [New York State Senate](https://github.com/nysenate/OpenLegislation
) for instance, publish their law on GitHub - because they too are shared text.

There are two things that make it particular useful.

Firstly multiple changes can be suggested and there are mechanisms to manage clashing ones.

Secondly two versions can be compared line-by-line.

The starting version of the Act of Voluntary Union is clearly an SNP-flavoured one. A world in which there is a Labour-flavoured one as well is easily imaginable. [Github](https://github.com) would enable the one to be compared against the other.

## Don't panic

If you want to have a go at improving our draft but don't know how to, if the thought of GitHub scares you, get in touch, I will help - gordon@hypernumbers.com

If your group has almost anyone in tech involved they will know how to use it too, so ask around.
