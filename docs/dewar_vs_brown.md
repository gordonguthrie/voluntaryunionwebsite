# Dewar Vs Brown

There is much talk that the Scottish Parliament is one of the most power subnational parliaments in the world. But the apparatus of government that Donald Dewar presided over as First Minister from May 1999 to his death in October 2000 was almost indistinguishable from that he controlled between May 1997 and May 1999.

The Scotland of the 1980s and 1990s, one of the poorest parts of the UK, became the 2nd richest after the Great Wen by 2022 because Donald Dewar systematically limited, restricted and bound the government of Scotland that he ran.

Dewar went into the first Scottish Parliament election with a solid majority of 179 in the Commons and came out a coalition government at Holyrood. The practice at Westminster was for the ministers of the Scottish Office to be subject to derisory levels of scrutiny, often late at night in an empty chamber. By comparison at Holyrood there were committees and FMQs in super-abundance.

Ministers decide, but they rarely paint on a blank canvass. Options are presented, opinions canvassed, decisions that are supportable emerge. The state has capabilities and ministers can only make use of them. Like a meteor in a dark sky there are Zelensky moments “I need ammunition, not a ride” but the quality of government is so much less about great men than is believed in the UK.

It is worth considering Gordon Brown’s constitutional reforms from a Dewarite persepective. Donald Dewar knew that the 134 FPTP bonus that underpinned his Secretary of Stateship was a false strength, that the enormous freedom of action that lack of oversight granted him was a weakness. It is a mark of his political greatness that his legacy was himself, his office, in chains.

Gordon Brown’s constitution would not constrain Gordon Brown at all. That which Gordon Brown wishes to do, devolution, more powers to local authorities in England, would be protected from Gordon Brown’s successors by entrenchment. The undemocratic Lords, whose role in the constitution is to occupy the space that genuine democratic checks on executive power should fill, is to be rightly abolished. But its successor is to be denied the powers that the Lords cannot exercise because of their lack of legitimacy. The old Lords could, but wouldn't, constrain Gordon Brown, the new Lords simply can't. The people would not be consulted on this: a supermajority on a minority vote would suffice.

The tragedy of Gordon Brown’s career was his astonishing leadership campaign. Not enough that he was nominated by MPs, not enough that he was nominated by a majority of MPs, not enough that he was nominated by so many MPs that none other could be, his juggernaut still rolled on demanding obeisance until all but 3 endorsed him. The tragedy of Gordon Brown, a man so brilliant in so many ways, is that he could not see how that apparent strength so weakened him. So stands his constitution - the Crown in Parliament, a hoarding of power, the strong centre retained. And the new tragedy of his constitution is this, it is not even his crown to wear, a vicarious crown, but a legacy crown.

The Scottish Labour Party, and to a less extent the Scottish Tories are caught in De Valera's dilemma.

In the 1920's Dev had declared both that *the people of Ireland [are] the exclusive source of all authority* and *the Irish People have no right to be wrong*. In the 1930s he slipped the horns, left Sinn Féin, dropped the IRA, signed the oath and recognised the state - the people did indeed have the right to be wrong.
