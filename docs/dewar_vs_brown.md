# Dewar Vs Brown

Allegedly the Scottish Parliament is one of the most powerful subnational parliaments in the world. But the Scottish state hardly changed in 1999. The levers of power on Secretary of State Donald Dewar's desk in 1997 where still there when he became First Minister in 1999.

The Scotland of the 1980s and 1990s, one of the poorest parts of the UK, became the 2nd richest by 2022 because Donald Dewar systematically limited, restricted and bound the government of Scotland that he ran.

Dewar went into the first Scottish Parliament election with a solid majority of 179 in the Commons and came out a coalition government at Holyrood. The Scotland Office had derisory levels of scrutiny at Westminster. Holyrood was the exact opposite.

Ministers decide, but they rarely paint on a blank canvass. Options are presented, opinions canvassed, decisions that are supportable emerge. Minsters can only do what the state is capable of. There are Zelensky moments like a meteor in a dark sky: “I need ammunition, not a ride” but the quality of government is less about great men than good institutions.

<span class="newthought">It is worth considering Gordon Brown’s constitutional reforms</span> from a Dewarite persepective. Donald Dewar knew that the 134 FPTP bonus was a false strength. That lack of oversight, and freedom of action, was a weakness. It is a mark of his political greatness that his legacy was himself, his office, in chains.

Gordon Brown’s constitution would not constrain Gordon Brown at all. That which Gordon Brown wishes to do would be protected from his successors by entrenchment.

The Lords have powers they cannot use as they lack legitimacy. Gordon Brown would replace them with a legitimate elected chamber, but strip it of the unused powers
 *the power to check the PM is the point of reform*.

The people would not be consulted on his schemes: a supermajority on a minority vote would suffice.

The tragedy of Gordon Brown’s career was his astonishing leadership campaign. Not enough that he was nominated by MPs, not enough that he was nominated by a majority of MPs, not enough that he was nominated by so many MPs that none other could be, his juggernaut still rolled on demanding obeisance until all but 3 endorsed him.

Weakness through strength was the nemesis and hubris of Gordon Brown, a man so brilliant in so many ways.

The Crown in Parliament, the hoarding of power, the strong centre retained, is this redux. And its a vicarious crown, not even his to wear.

<span class="newthought">The Scottish Labour Party</span>, and to a less extent the Scottish Tories are caught in De Valera's dilemma.

In the 1920's Dev had declared both that *the people of Ireland [are] the exclusive source of all authority* and *the Irish People have no right to be wrong*. In the 1930s he slipped the horns, left Sinn Féin, dropped the IRA, signed the oath and recognised the state - the people did indeed have the right to be wrong.
