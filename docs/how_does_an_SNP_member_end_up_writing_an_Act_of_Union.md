# How does an SNP member end up writing an Act of Union - and other comedies

A good rule in politics is to always punch the bruise - the bruise here is *is the UK a voluntary union?*

The SNP is a constitutional party in an aconstitutional state. The constitution of the UK is not a normal contract between people and state but a catspaw of anyone who has seized the crown-in-parliament courtesy of an antiquated electoral system with its crazy winner’s bonus.

Our politics is trapped in this aconstitutionality. There is no direct Scottish Parliamentary constitutional electoral route to an agreed referendum - some mandates are more equal than others. The Supreme Court has ruled. We have run out of road.

We are in a constitutional crisis, but one that encompasses the rest of the UK.

To win we need to stand on the ground where we are strong - to put our opponents into a position where they don’t want to be and to actively shape and ride it.

The mathematics of victory are simple:

* a low 20s percent support an independent Scotland unconditionally
* a high teens, the UK likewise
* and the rest who will vote in the national interest of Scotland.

Our job is to fashion a political strategy that binds two of those 3 camps into a majority position - and to do that we should start from the national interest of Scotland.

Nobody believes in parliamentary sovereignty in a serious sense, and the political class has been captured by entitled actors who use the power it grants them arbitrarily.

But the UK is only partially aconstitutional: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have mostly-written constitutions. The principle of popular sovereignty is inscribed in treaty and law in the Good Friday Agreement and by custom and practice of referendums in the popular mind - particular in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but also inchoately across England.

The hook on which the post-Brexit Tories are trapped is that the people voted for it, the implicitly sovereign people voted for it.

We stand four-square for popular sovereignty, for the peoples of Scotland to determine their own fate. Our institutions are strong and respected, far more so than Westminster. Our politicians of all parties are held in higher regard than their counterparts south of the Border. Our country and society, constrained as they are by Westminster, work.

An election-as-referendum is winnable only if it is seen as a last resort. Before we go to it we need to lay out a retail offering to all voters, SNP or otherwise, one that speaks to their concerns.

To that end I proposing that we do what our opponents do not expect us to - to reach out, to make a grand offering with an open hand. An involuntary union is intolerable, a voluntary union is only what we sought when we asked for a Section 30 and a Supreme Court ruling.

To that end I have drafted a Westminster Act of Voluntary Union - based on British constitutional precedents.

The Brexit crisis is all consuming, its flames lick up the side of the rock of Gibraltar. A chaotic end, an end that slows us returning to Europe, that impedes us becoming a normal European country is not what we want. It is in our interest to move the debate from party to government, to speak to Wales, and Gibraltar, to bring in the Commonwealth succession and the Irish, to internationalise and widen. England will not go, it is in our interest to shape the world after Britain.

We in the SNP do not want Scotland to be independent, we want the people of Scotland to want to be independent and have the means and mechanisms to make that so. Belief in the sovereignty of the Scottish people is what unites us, what makes this an issue of country not party.

And if, after all, there are to be tanks on lawns, better their lawns and our tanks.
